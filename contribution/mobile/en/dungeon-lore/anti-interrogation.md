You see a corpse...

You've seen lots of corpses, so you do what you normally do. Scavenge. You start by going through the corpse's pockets, searching for anything you can use. You don't find anything of value, assuming some choom already beat you to it. 

You're no biotech surgeon, but after the first few times of cutting into flesh, you don't become queasy anymore. You decide to start with the eyes, knowing that ocular tech usually fetches a greater value. Pushing a button on your multi tool, a sharpened spoon shaped tool pops out. You put the spoon to the corpse's eye and as you press around the orb, the mouth begins to move.

"Five," it says. You jerk back in surprise, at first thinking that the corpse isn't a corpse after all. "Four," it continues. Now you know what is happening and you jump back behind a pillar, grateful for a place of refuge. The corpse finishes the countdown. "Three... Two... One..."

The blast is deafening. The corpse explodes covering the room with it's insides. The walls have become painted maroon with bits of flesh and metal from the corpse's implants. You've heard of the anti-interrogation implants that certain syndicates require their members to get, but you never knew anyone stupid enough to put the syndicate above their own life. You guess whoever this poor choom was thought it was worth the Bitcoin. 

You search through the bits of metal shrapnel but quickly realize that whatever the implants had been is no more. Unfortunately you didn't gain anything you can use or trade from this, but at least you still have your life and maybe a valuable lesson.
